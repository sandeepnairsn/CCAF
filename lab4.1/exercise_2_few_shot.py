"""Exercise 2 (starter) - Few-shot examples to lock consistent output.

Run:  python exercise_2_few_shot.py

Instructions alone give inconsistent shapes. Your job: fill in
FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES with three labeled examples in the EXACT target format, then
run the script and compare format compliance against the zero-shot prompt.

Compliance is scored with a strict regex:  ^(REMOVE|REVIEW|ALLOW) \\| .+

# rationale. Cover the label space: one REMOVE, one ALLOW, one REVIEW.

# Each example should look exactly like:
#     Report: <a short report>
#     ACTION | one short rationale
#
# Use UPPERCASE actions and a single " | " separator. Separate examples with a
# blank line. Do NOT include a "{report}" placeholder in here - the examples are
# fixed demonstrations; the live report is appended below.

Report: A user posted another member's home address and employer.

Report: A thread has escalating personal insults between two users.
