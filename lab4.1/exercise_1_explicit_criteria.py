"""Exercise 1 (starter) - Explicit criteria to cut false positives.

Run:  python exercise_1_explicit_criteria.py

Same model, two prompts. A VAGUE prompt lets REMOVE sprawl into wrongful
takedowns (false positives). Your job: replace the EXPLICIT_PROMPT placeholder
below with clear, TESTABLE definitions of each action plus a fail-safe
tie-break, then run the script and compare.

The scorer tracks two things on eight labeled reports:
  1. overall accuracy
  2. the count of wrongful "remove" calls (the failure that actually matters)

# TODO (Exercise 1): write EXPLICIT_PROMPT.
#
# Replace the placeholder string below with clear, testable definitions of each
# action. Your prompt should:
#   - define REMOVE narrowly (only unambiguous violations - e.g. doxxing /
#     exposure of private personal data, a credible threat against a specific
#     person, or clearly illegal content; "no reasonable doubt")
#   - define REVIEW as "needs a human" (likely spam, borderline harassment,
#     ambiguous threats, heated arguments)
#   - define ALLOW as rude/blunt/off-topic/unpopular but NOT a violation
#   - include a tie-break rule: if unsure between remove and review, choose review
#   - keep "{report}" as a placeholder and ask for one word only
#
# The prompt MUST contain the substring "{report}" so .format(report=...) works.
# =====================================================================
EXPLICIT_PROMPT = """Choose the action using these exact definitions:
